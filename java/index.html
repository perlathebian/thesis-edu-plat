            <h2>Introduction to Java</h2>
            <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was designed with a few key 
            principles in mind: platform independence, simplicity, and security.</p>

            <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Java programs can run on any device that has the Java 
                Virtual Machine (JVM), making it a "write once, run anywhere" language.<p>For detailed information on Java's platform independence, visit 
                    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/intro/definition.html" target="_blank">this page</a>.</p>
                    </li>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java follows the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, 
                emphasizing the use of classes and objects for modular and efficient code.</li>
                <li><strong>Syntax and Structure:</strong> Java syntax is similar to other C-based languages, 
                making it accessible to developers familiar with languages like C++ or C#.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Java handles memory management automatically through its 
                garbage collection mechanism, reducing the risk of memory leaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Java incorporates built-in security features, such as the sandbox 
                model, to protect against malicious activities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Basic Components:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Classes and Objects:</strong> Java is designed around the concept of classes and 
                objects, allowing developers to structure code in a modular and reusable manner.</li>
                <li><strong>Variables and Data Types:</strong> Java supports various data types, including 
                primitive types (int, float, char) and reference types (objects).</li>
                <li><strong>Control Flow:</strong> Java provides constructs for decision-making (if, else 
                statements), looping (for, while loops), and branching.</li>
                <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Functions in Java are called methods and are defined within classes. 
                They allow for code organization and reuse.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Getting Started:</h3>
            <p>To start programming in Java, you need to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html" target="_blank">Install</a> the Java Development Kit (JDK), which includes the Java compiler and other tools needed 
                for development.</li>
                <li>Set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) likeSet up an IDE like 
                    <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a>, 
                    <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows">IntelliJ</a>, or 
                    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">Visual Studio 
                Code</a> for a more efficient coding experience.</li>
                <li>Write your first "Hello, World!" program to ensure that your development environment is set 
                up correctly.

            <h2>Basic Syntax and Data Types in Java</h2>
                <p>Java has a straightforward syntax and supports various data types to handle different kinds of information. Let's explore the basic syntax and data types:</p>
        
                <h3>Basic Syntax:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hello, World! Program:</strong></li>
                    <div class="code-container">
                        <button class="edit-run-btn">Edit & Run</button>

                     </div>
                    <li><strong>Comments:</strong> Use <code>//</code> for single-line comments and <code>/* */</code> for multi-line comments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Declaring Variables:</strong></li>
                    <div class="code-container">

                     </div>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Data Types:</h3>
                <p>Java supports two main categories of data types: primitive and reference.</p>
        
                <h4>Primitive Data Types:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Integer Types:</strong> <code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code></li>
                    <li><strong>Floating-Point Types:</strong> <code>float</code>, <code>double</code></li>
                    <li><strong>Character Type:</strong> <code>char</code></li>
                    <li><strong>Boolean Type:</strong> <code>boolean</code></li>
                </ul>
        
                <h4>Reference Data Types:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objects:</strong> Instances of classes</li>
                    <li><strong>Arrays:</strong> Collections of elements of the same type</li>
                    <div class="code-container">
                        <button class="edit-run-btn">Edit & Run</button>

                            <code>
                                <span class="comment">// Array of integers </span>
                                <span class="keyword">int</span>[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                    </div>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Operators:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Arithmetic Operators:</strong> <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code></li>
                    <li><strong>Comparison Operators:</strong> <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code></li>
                    <li><strong>Logical Operators:</strong> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> (AND), <code>||</code> (OR), <code>!</code> (NOT)</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Control Flow:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conditional Statements:</strong> <code>if</code>, <code>else if</code>, <code>else</code></li>
                    <li><strong>Looping Statements:</strong> <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>do-while</code></li>
                </ul>
        
                <p>These are foundational concepts in Java programming, and understanding them is crucial as you delve into more advanced topics.</p>
                <p>In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename. For example, you can create your 
                    Java file, called Main.java (this can be done in any text editor). The file can contain a ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù message, written with 
                    the following code:</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <button class="edit-run-btn">Edit & Run</button>
                    <pre><code>
                        <span class = "keyword">public</span> <span class = "keyword">class</span> HelloWorld {
                        <span class = "keyword">   public</span> <span class = "keyword">static</span> <span class = "keyword">void</span> main(String[] args) {
                                System.out.println(<span class="string">"Hello, World!"</span>);
                            }
                    }</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>Every code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named it Main. A class should always start with an 
                    upper-case first letter. The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args)</code></pre>. 
                    Any code inside the main() method will be executed.</p>   
                <p>In the <b>main()</b> method, we can use the <b>println()</b> method to print a line of text to the screen. System is 
                    a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for ‚Äúoutput‚Äù . The  <b>println()</b> 
                    method, short for ‚Äúprint line‚Äù, is used to print a value to the screen (or a file). Note that each code statement must end with a 
                    semicolon ‚Äú;‚Äù. When working with text, it must be wrapped inside double quotation marks ‚Äú ‚Äù, else an error occurs. There is also a 
                    <b>print()</b> method, similar to  <b>println()</b>; the only difference is that it doesn‚Äôt produce 
                    a new line at the end of the output. You can also use  <b>println()</b> to print numbers, however, we don‚Äôt put them 
                    in double quotes like we do with texts.</p>    
                <pre><code>System.out.println(416); </code></pre>
                <p>You can also perform mathematical operation inside the println() method:</p>
                <pre><code>System.out.println(4 + 6); //10
System.out.println(5 * 4); //20 </code></pre>
                <h4>Java Comments</h4>
                <p>Java comments can be used to explain code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing 
                    alternative code. </p>

            <h2>Data Types and Variables</h2>
            <h3>Java Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables are named storage locations that hold data, and they can be declared using a specific data type. A variable declaration in Java 
            typically looks like:</p>
            <pre><code>dataType variableName;</code></pre>  
            <p>In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>String - stores text, such as ‚ÄúHello‚Äù. String values should be wrapped inside double quotes</li>
                <li>int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 63 or -128.</li>
                <li>float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as -54.33 or 54.33</li>
                <li>char - stores single characters, such as ‚Äòb‚Äô or ‚ÄòB‚Äô. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</li>
                <li>boolean - stores values with two states: true or false</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Declaring a Variable</h3>
            <p>To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value using the following syntax:</p>
            <pre><code>dataType variableName = value;</code></pre>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <div class = "code-container">
                <button class = "edit-run-btn">Edit & Run</button>
                <pre><code>
                    <span class = "keyword">String</span> name = <span class = "string">"Joe"</span>; <span class = "comment">//creating a variable of type String and assigning it the value "Joe"</span>
                    <span class = "keyword">int</span> number = 17; <span class = "comment">//creating a variable of type int and assigning it the value 15</span>
                </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>You can also re-assign a value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:</p>
            <div class = "code-container">
                <button class = "edit-run-btn">Edit & Run</button>
                <pre><code>
                    <span class = "keyword">int</span> number = 17;
            number = 89; <span class = "comment">//new value is now 89
            /*If you don't want others or yourself to overwrite an exisitng value
            you can use the final keyword; this will declare the value as "final" or
            "constant", which means immutable(unchangeable) and read-only*/</span>
            <span class = "keyword">final</span> <span class = "keyword">int</span> number = 17;
            number = 89; <span class = "comment">// this will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable</span>
                </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>You can try for yourself displaying variables using the <b>println()</b>method, and concatenating different variables (using the plus sign +). 
            Note: concatenating or adding different variable types might generate errors depending on the types used. (example: you cannot add an integer 
            to a text).</p>

            <h3>Naming Variables:</h3>
            <p>Variable names are called identifiers. They should always start with lower-case letters and can contain letters, digits, underscores, and 
            dollar signs. Names are case-sensitive (<b>myNum</b> is different from <b>mynum</b>). Reserved words like Java keywords  (such as <b>int</b> 
            or <b>boolean</b>) cannot be used as identifiers/names.</p>

            <h3>Data Types</h3>
            <p>Data types are divided into two groups:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primitive data types - include byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, and char.
                    <ul><li>A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays, and Classes (more on these later)
                    <ul><li>Non-primitive data types are called <b>reference types</b> because they refer to objects.</li></ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The main difference between <b>primitive</b> and <b>non-primitive</b> data types are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java 
                (except for <b>String</b>).</li>
                <li>Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.</li>
                <li>A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be <b>null</b>.</li>
                <li>A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Type Casting</h3>
            <p>Type casting refers to the process of converting a variable from one data type to another, allowing the variable to be used in expressions 
                or operations that require a different type. In Java, there are two types of casting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Widening casting (automatic) - converts a smaller type to a larger type size:
                    byte ‚Üí short ‚Üí char ‚Üí int ‚Üí long ‚Üí float ‚Üí double</li>
                <li>Narrowing casting (manual) - converts a larger type to a smaller type size:
                    double ‚Üí float ‚Üí long ‚Üí int ‚Üí char ‚Üí short ‚Üí byte</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Functions and Methods</h2>

            <p>A method is a block of code which only runs when it's called. Data, known as parameters, can be passed into a method. Methods are used to 
            perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions. They are used to reuse code by defining the code once, and using it many 
            times.
            </p>

            <h3>Creating a Method</h3>

            <p>A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses <b>()</b>. Java provides some 
            pre-defined methods, such as<b>System.out.println()</b>, but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
            //syntax of creating a method inside Main
            public class Main{
                static void myMethod(){
                    //code to be executed
                }
            }
            </code></pre>
            
            <ul>
            <li><b>myMethod()</b> is the name of the method</li>
            <li><b>static</b> means that the method belongs to the Main class and not an object of the Main class (more on how to access methods through 
                objects in OOP section). </li>
            <li>To call a method in Java, write the method's name followed by two parentheses <b>()</b> and a semicolon <b>;</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Exceptions</h2>

            <p>Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. Different errors can occur: 
            coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, or other unforeseeable things.
            </p>
            
            <p>When an error occurs, Java will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: Java will <em>throw</em> 
            an <b>exception</b>(throw an error). Exception handling in Java is done using <b>try</b>, <b>catch</b>, and <b>finally</b> blocks.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><b>try</b> block: It contains the code that might throw an exception.</li>
            
            <li><b>catch</b> block: It contains the code that is executed if an exception occurs in the corresponding try block. Multiple catch blocks can 
                be used to handle different types of exceptions.
            </li>
            <li><b>finally</b> block: It contains the code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It's typically 
                used for cleanup tasks.
            </li>
            </ul>   

            <p>Here's the syntax:</p>

            <pre><code>
                try {
                    // Code that might throw an exception
                } catch (ExceptionType1 e1) {
                    // Code to handle ExceptionType1
                } catch (ExceptionType2 e2) {
                    // Code to handle ExceptionType2
                } finally {
                    // Code that always executes
                }
            </code></pre>

            <p>In this example, the <b>divide</b> method attempts to perform a division operation that may result in an <b>ArithmeticException</b>. The 
            <b>try</b> block is used to enclose this code, and the <b>catch</b> block handles the specific exception type. The <b>finally</b> block always
            executes, whether an exception occurs or not.</p>

            <h2>OOP Concepts</h2>

            <p><b>Object-Oriented Programming</b> (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around the concept of "objects", which 
            represents real-world entities and encapsulate data and behavior. Key principles of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
            </p>

            <p><b>Encapsulation</b> involves bundling data (<b>attributes</b>) and <b>methods</b> (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit 
            (<b>object</b>).
            </p> 
            <p><b>Inheritance</b> allows objects to inherit properties and behaviors from other objects, promoting code reuse. </p>

            <p><b>Polymorphism</b> allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type, providing flexibility and extensibility in 
            code design. 
            </p>

            <p>OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and a more intuitive way of modeling complex systems.</p>

            <p><b>Classes</b> and <b>objects</b> are two main aspects of object-oriented programming. For example, class <i>Fruit</i> could have objects 
            like <i>Apple, Banana, Mango</i>. Another example, class <i>Car</i> could have objects like <i>Volvo, Audi, and Toyota</i>.  So, a class is 
            a <em>template</em> for objects, and an object is an <em>instance</em> of a class. When the individual objects are created, they inherit all 
            the variables and methods from the class.
            </p>

            <p>Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. 
            The car has <b>attributes</b>, such as weight and color, and <b>methods</b>, such as drive and brake. A class is like an object constructor, 
            or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
            </p>

            <div class = "code-container">
                <button class = "edit-run-btn">Edit & Run</button>
                <pre><code>
            <span class = "comment">//creating a class called Car with member variables</span>

                <span class = "keyword">public</span> <span class = "keyword">void</span> drive(){
                    System.out.println(<span class = "string">"The car is driving"</span>);
                }
            }

            <span class = "comment">/*creating an object from the class; specify the class name,

                Car car1 = <span class = "keyword">new</span> Car();
                car1.color = "red";
                car1.speed = "100";
                car1.model = "ABCDE";
                System.out.println(car1.color);
            }
            </code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>The term <b>variable</b> or member variable refers to the attribute or member field of the class. In the above example, the Car class has 
            attributes color, speed, model. You can access attributes by creating an object of the class (car1), and using the dot syntax (<b>.</b>). 
            This way you can also assign values to the attributes. If you don't want the ability to override existing values, declare the attribute as 
            <b>final</b>. 
            </p>

            <h3>Class Methods</h3>

            <p>Example: drive() in the Car class; prints a text (action), when it is called. To call a method, write the method's name followed by two 
            parentheses <b>()</b> and a semicolon <b>;</b>.
            </p>

            <h3>Constructors</h3>

            <p>A <b>constructor</b> is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. 
            It can be used to set initial values for object attributes:</p>

            <div class = "code-container">

            </div>
            <i>Note that you cannot create another constructor in the same class with the same parameters.</i>

            <p>This example adds an int <i>y</i> parameter to the constructor. Inside the constructor we set <i>x</i> to <i>y</i>. When we call the 
            constructor, we pass a parameter to the constructor (5), which will set the value of <i>x</i> to 5.
            </p>

            <h3>Access Modifiers</h3>

            <p>For classes, you can either use <b>public</b> (class would be accessible by any other class) or <b>default</b> (class is only accessible in 
            the same package). For attributes, methods, and constructors, you can either use <b>public</b> (code accessible to all classes), <b>private</b> 
            (code is only accessible within the declared class), <b>default</b> (code is accessible in the same package), or <b>protected</b> (code is 
            accessible in the package and subclasses).
            </p>

            <h3>Non-Access Modifiers</h3>

            <p>For classes you can either use <b>final</b> (class cannot be inherited by other classes), or <b>abstract</b> (class cannot be used to create 
            objects, to access the class, it must inherited from another class). For attributes and methods, you can use <b>final</b> (attributes and 
            methods cannot be overridden/modified), <b>static</b> (attributes and methods belong to the class rather than an object), <b>abstract</b> 
            (can only be used in an abstract class, and can only be used on methods; the method does not have a body, the body will be provided by the 
            subclass it inherited from ), <b>transient</b> (attributes and methods are skipped when serializing the object containing them), 
            <b>synchronized</b> (methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time), or <b>volatile</b> (value of an attribute is not cached 
            thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory").
            </p>

            <h3>Encapsulation</h3>

            <p>This concept makes sure that sensitive data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must declare member variables as private them provide 
            public get and set methods to access and update the values of those member variables.
            </p>

            <p>We've established that private variables can only be accessed within the same class, however, with <b>getters</b> and <b>setters</b> (these 
            being public methods), it is possible to access private variables from an outside class. The getter method returns the value of the variable 
            while the setter sets this value. The syntax for both methods is they both start with get or set followed by the name of the variable 
            capitalized (first letter is upper-case).
            </p>

            <h3>Inheritance</h3>

            <p>This involves inheriting attributes and methods from one class to another, thus having a <b>subclass (child)</b> inheriting from a <b>superclass 
            (parent)</b>. To inherit from a class, use the keyword <b>extends</b>.
            </p>

            <p>In the example below, the <i>Car</i> class (subclass) inherits the attributes and methods from the <i>Vehicle</i> class (superclass):</p>

            <div class = "code-container">
                <button class = "edit-run-btn">Edit & Run</button>
                <pre><code>

            <span class = "keyword">public</span> <span class = "keyword">void</span> honk() {  <span class = "comment">// Vehicle method</span>
                System.out.println(<span class = "string">"Tuut, tuut!"</span>);
            }
            }

            <span class = "keyword">class</span> Car <span class = "keyword">extends</span> Vehicle {

            <span class = "keyword">public</span> <span class = "keyword">static</span> <span class = "keyword">void</span> main(String[] args) {

                <span class = "comment">// Create a myCar object</span>
                Car myCar = <span class = "keyword">new</span> Car();

                <span class = "comment">// Call the honk() method (from the Vehicle class) on the myCar object</span>
                myCar.honk();

                <span class = "comment">// Display the value of the brand attribute (from the Vehicle class) and the value of the modelName from the Car class</span>
                System.out.println(myCar.brand + <span class = "string">" "</span> + myCar.modelName);
            }
            }
                </code></pre>
            </div>

            <i>Note</u>: if you try to access a final class, this will generate an error.</i>

            <h3>Polymorphism</h3>

            <p>This means <b>‚Äúmany forms‚Äù</b>, and this occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. As mentioned before, 
            inheritance allows us to inherit methods and attributes from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This 
            allows us to perform a single action in different ways. <br>
            In this example, we have a superclass <i>Animal</i> that has a method called <i>animalSound()</i>. Subclasses of <i>Animal</i> could be 
            <i>Birds</i> and <i>Dogs</i>, and they also have their own implementation of an animal sound.
            </p>
